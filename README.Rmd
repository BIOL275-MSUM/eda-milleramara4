## Abstract

From the Palmer Penguins site, there were two datasets that could be explored. The penguin dataset is what is going to be explored for this project. The main purpose of this dataset is to give an example of great data to use for analysis and visualization. Many different variables are provided when the data is being presented. It is important to be able to  compare the size measurements of three different species of penguins on three different islands in Antarctica. To be specific this project will be more focused on how the size measurements vary compared to what islands that they live on. To accomplish this goal, the data analysis software of RStudio will be utilized. This will be helpful when downloading all of the data that is needed and when creating graphs to compare measurements. From there, the next step would be to have one measurement on the x-axis and one measurement on the y-axis and then add what islands the penguins are located on to see if there is a correlation. 

## Introduction

There is a wide range of research that is being studied at the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research study area. It is one of three research stations located in Antartica, so that means their main focus is on the marine ecosystem, which includes research on penguins. Three different species of penguin were researched like the Adelie, Gentoo, and the Chinstrap penguins.

The research also took place on three unique islands which are the Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen islands.

Each penguin species is going to adapt to its own unique environment on a specific island. The objective is trying to figure out if there is going to be a relationship between the size measurements of the penguin and the island that it lives on. It would be interesting to see if the size measurements of the penguins have any natural trend when they are compared to what island they live on. If there are major trends, it could be caused for a number of different reasons. One reason could depend on what species of penguin might live on that island and how large each of these species are, so that could cause an overall trend in the data. 


## Methods


### Data Acquisition 

- Data was taken from a website called "Palmer Penguins", which contains information about penguins on islands in Antartica (Horst et all, 2020).
- From the two datasets on the website, the penguins data is what was used.
- There were exact instructions on the palmer penguins website for how to download the package and the correct code to use. 
- The packages of tidyverse and palmerpenguins were then installed and the data was read into RStudio (RStudio, 2020), using the readr package (Hadley and Jim, 2020).

### Data Preparation

- The data was renamed to penguins_data for easier usage and manipulation, using the dyplr package in RStudio (Hadley et all, 2020).
- A few graphs were then created for visual aid to look closer and to compare the data from the penguins.
- Many different graphs were then created, including four scatterplots and four boxplots using the ggplot2 package in RStudio (H. Wickham, 2016).
- From there it is simple to visualize some trends in the graph and compare the size measurements of penguins and what island they live on.

## Results

I first created many different boxplots to compare each size measurement to what island the penguins lived on. I wanted to compare just one numerical variable of flipper length of the penguins to what island that they lived on, so I created a boxplot, which showed that the island of Biscoe had penguins with the longest flipper length. 

```{r}
flipper_boxplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=island, y=flipper_length_mm, fill = island)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=FALSE, outlier.colour="cadetblue3", outlier.shape=8,
               outlier.size=4)+
  labs(title = "Comparing Flipper Length and Island",
       x = "Island",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)", fill = "Island")
flipper_boxplot
```

The next comparison is the bill length of the penguin to what island it lives on.

```{r}
billlength_boxplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=island, y=bill_length_mm, fill=island)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch=FALSE, outlier.colour="coral1", outlier.shape=8,
               outlier.size=4)+
  labs(title = "Comparing Bill Length and Island",
       x = "Island",
       y = "Bill Length (mm)", fill = "Island")
billlength_boxplot
```

Another measurement that I compared to what island the penguin lived on was the depth of the bill.

```{r}
billdepth_boxplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=island, y=bill_depth_mm, fill=island)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch=FALSE, outlier.colour="coral", outlier.shape=8,
               outlier.size=4)+
  labs(title = "Comparing Bill Depth and Island",
       x = "Island",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)", fill = "Island")
billdepth_boxplot
```

The final comparison is the body mass of each penguin compared to the island that they live on.

```{r}
bodymass_boxplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x=island, y=body_mass_g, fill=island)) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch=FALSE, outlier.colour="green", outlier.shape=8,
               outlier.size=4)+
  labs(title = "Comparing Body Mass and Island",
       x = "Island",
       y = "Body Mass (g)", fill = "Island")
bodymass_boxplot
```


I then created a scatterplot in which I am seeing if there is a trend between bill depth and bill length within the three islands. 
```{r}
length_and_depth <- ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = island)) +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Bill Length and Bill Depth on Islands",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")
length_and_depth
```

I next added best fit lines to get a better view of what the trend actually is in each island. 
```{r}
length_and_depthline <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Size Measurements and Island",
       x = "Bill Length (mm)",
       y = "Bill Depth (mm)")
length_and_depthline
```

I couldn't really see a natural trend from that graph from any of the size measurements, so I decided to go another route and see if there was a trend with flipper length and body mass compared to the island.

```{r}
flipper_and_mass <- ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)) +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Flipper Length and Body Mass on Islands",
     x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
     y = "Body Mass (g)")
flipper_and_mass
```

I could kind of tell that there was a little bit of a trend, but to get a better look I made the graph have best fit lines.

```{r}
flipper_and_massline <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Best Fit Lines Comparing Flipper Length and Body Mass",
       x = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       y = "Body Mass (g)", fill = "Island")
flipper_and_massline
```

From there I wanted to create a graph to represent what species of penguin was on each island to determine the trends I was seeing.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1)+
  labs(title = "Species of Penguin on Each Island",
       x = "Island",
       y = "Count", fill = "Species")
```


## Discussion

After all of the results were found, it was kind of challenging to really compare the size measurements of penguins to what island they live on. There is not much research out there that digs deep into this concept, whether there is a trend in the data or there isn't. Some things that were discovered in this data had to do with the island of Biscoe. After creating those four boxplots, it was easy to notice that Biscoe had penguins with the largest flipper length and it had penguins with the largest body mass. From there, another graph was created to see if there was some sort of correlation. After making the scatterplot with the flipper length on the x-axis and the body mass on the y-axis, there seemed to be a visual trend going on with the island of Biscoe. With the best fit lines, the island of Biscoe had a positive slope, which showed that there was a positive correlation. One reason that this would happen would be depending on what kind of penguins might happen to live on that island. A graph was then made that showed how many of each species of penguin was located on each island. This graph showed that the island of Biscoe mainly had the Gentoo penguin. The positive correlation with flipper length and body mass made sense, because the Gentoo species is the largest of the three species. Also from that same graph, it is noticable that the species of penguins aren't spread out that much, so that is another reason why it was kind of difficult to notice more trends throughout the data. Some more results I got showed how the island of Torgersen had the largest bill depth and how the island of Dream had the longest bill length. Overall, it is was easy to notice one major trend throughout the data and some other small results shown through other graphs like scatterplots and boxplots. These results show how it is important to get a wide spread of data in order to be able to see more prominant trends.
